    <img id="profile-img" src="images\profile.png" alt="Jonathan Tran">

    <p>There are a lot of things to know about me.</p>
    <p>I was born in Amarillo and spent equal amounts of time in Dallas, Austin and Houston.</p>
    <p>I have a degree in business marketing and a master's degree in Human Resources Management. I am currently
      learning html, css, and java and enrolled in SMU's Coding Bootcamp. My end goal is to enter another industry.</p>
    <p>I enjoy learning new things, experiencing new things and creating new things. I also really enjoy relaxing with
      videogames. I'll add more in the future but do not hesitate to contact me with any questions.</p>
