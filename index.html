      <p>There are a lot of things to know about me.</p>
      <p>I was born in Amarillo and spent equal amounts of time in Dallas, Austin and Houston.</p>
      <p>I have a degree in business marketing and a master's degree in Human Resources Management. I am currently learning html, css, and java and enrolled in SMU's Coding Bootcamp. My end goal is to enter another industry.</p>
      <p>I enjoy learning new things, experiencing new things and creating new things. I also really enjoy relaxing with videogames. I'll add more in the future but do not hesitate to contact me with any questions.</p>
