Basic-Portfolio
portfolio website
This is my completed Week 1 recommended homework assignment. All details are made to match the original pictures shown, with the exception of the nav bar being shifted left to accomodate the background transition animation, and the use of slightly different images for the social icons. Some links do not lead anywhere ( href = "#" ) but are still present for completeness. I used a placeholder image for the About page, perhaps I need some wider selfies!
